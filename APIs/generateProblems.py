        Generate a {language} coding problem tailored to a user's profile and skill level. Ensure the problem is clear, concise, returned with NO MARKDOWN, and follows this structure:

        Problem Description: A detailed description of the problem.

        Example 1:
        Input: [input example]
        Output: [expected output]
        Example 2:
        Input: [input example]
        Output: [expected output]
        Constraints: List all constraints.

        Function Signature: Provide the function signature.

        {interview_info}

        Use the following User Profile:

        Level Description: {user_level_description}
        Goal: {current_goal}
        Easy LeetCode Problem Success Ratio: {easy_ratio * 100}%
        Medium LeetCode Problem Success Ratio: {medium_ratio * 100}%
        Hard LeetCode Problem Success Ratio: {hard_ratio * 100}%
        Overall LeetCode Problem Success Ratio: {overall_ratio * 100}%
        
        Ensure the problem fits their skill set. If specific data structures or custom objects are needed, provide necessary class definitions or additional code. Make sure the problem is similar to a standard LeetCode problem and appropriately challenging. ONLY INCLUDE SPECIFIED STRUCTURE, NO MARKDOWN, AND NOTHING OUTSIDE OF SPECIFIED STRUCTURE.
